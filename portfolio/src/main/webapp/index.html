      <p style= "color:royalblue">My name is Arlet Miranda. I was born and raised by a single mother in San Jose, CA. 
          I am a sophomore at UC Berkeley. I am currently residing in on-campus dorms. I love running and playing 
          the bass guitar. Fun facts: My favorite animal are pigs &#128055; and I have a pet hamster named S'mores. </p>

            in my Data Structures course</li>
        <li>Learned how to write test cases in order to test the correctness of my code</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
